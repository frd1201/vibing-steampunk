// A cross-reference row says which *include* holds a reference, and for a class
// that include is a method: ZCL_X===========CM001. Upward tracing wants the
// method, and the number is not the answer on its own.
//
// The mapping is in TMDIR — (CLASSNAME, METHODINDX, METHODNAME) — and the CM
// suffix is that index in **hexadecimal**. One class read today had CM001,
// CM003, CM009 and CM00A, which decode to methods 1, 3, 9 and 10. Decimal would
// have no A in it, so the base is not a guess.
//
// Two things this replaces, both of which looked reasonable and were wrong:
// reading the include as a program (a class-pool include is not addressable
// that way — 500 and 404), and taking the number as a position in the source (it
// is assigned when a method is created, so a method written later and inserted
// earlier gets a higher number).
//
// SAP's own resolver, CL_OO_CLASSNAME_SERVICE=>GET_METHOD_BY_INCLUDE, does not
// read TMDIR at all: it issues SYSTEM-CALL QUERY METHOD INCLUDE, a kernel call
// unavailable to us. TMDIR is the same knowledge in a table, and a table is
// readable over plain ADT with no Z code.
